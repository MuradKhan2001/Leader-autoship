                <h4>WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT?</h4>
                <p>- You will get a call or text messages from one of our specialists asking exact pickup - drop off
                    addresses, contact info of the person who will give and receive the vehicle.</p>

                <p>- The agent contacts you 1-2 days before pickup date to update you with an available driver in the
                    area.</p>

                <p>- Once everything is scheduled the agent forwards you the driverâ€™s contact info so that you can get
                    an direct update during transfer.</p>
